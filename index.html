        <strong>Salaar: Part 1 </strong> – Ceasefire &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        is a <em>2023</em> Indian Telugu-language epic action thriller film 
        directed by Prashanth Neel and produced by Vijay Kiragandur under Hombale Films. The film 
        stars Prabhas in the titular role, alongside Prithviraj Sukumaran,Shruti Haasan, Jagapathi 
        Babu, Bobby Simha, Sriya Reddy, Ramachandra Raju, John Vijay, Easwari Rao, Tinnu Anand, 
        Devaraj, Brahmaji and Mime Gopi. In the fictional dystopian city-state of Khansaar, where 
        monarchy still exists, the film follows the friendship between Deva (Prabhas), the exiled 
        prince of Khansaar, and Varadha (Prithviraj Sukumaran), the current prince of Khansaar. When 
        a coup d'état is planned by his father's ministers and his relatives, Varadha enlists Deva's 
        help to become Khansaar's undisputed ruler.

        The film's initial storyline was pitched from Neel's debut film Ugramm (2014) and is the maiden 
        part of a two-part film.[4] It was officially announced in December 2020 under the title Salaar,
        however, in July 2023, its first installment was titled as Salaar: Part 1 – Ceasefire. Principal 
        photography commenced in January 2021, and occurred sporadically in several legs over nearly 
        three years, before wrapping in late 2023. Filming locations included Telangana, Italy and 
        Budapest. Production difficulties, ranging from the pandemic, reshoots and VFX delays, postponed 
        Salaar's release date several times. The music is composed by Ravi Basrur, cinematography handled
        by Bhuvan Gowda and editing by Ujwal Kulkarni.
